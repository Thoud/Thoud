## Robert Miron - Frontend Developer

Hey there 👋 I'm Robert, a developer based in Vienna, Austria. 

Since Highschool I was dreaming about being a developer but at every major decision in life I decided against it and guess what. Now I didn't! 🥳

After attending a bootcamp in Vienna I finally made the leap and landed in the magical realm of web development. 🧙‍♂️
